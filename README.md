Starting from August 2022, after obtaining my bachelor in IT I decided to take a year off to implement what sould resemble a game engine. 
The main goal is to get as much as possible hands on experience on some aspects and systems that are part of a 3D Engine.

## Current Features
- [x] Basic Mesh Rendering
- [x] Skinned Animation
- [x] Basic shader abstraction
    - Single file vertex/fragment shaders...
- [ ] Lighting
- [ ] Materials
- [ ] Font Rendering
- [ ] Immediate GUI
- [ ] Retained GUI

Currently using OpenGL.

## Third party libraries

- SDL2 (not used for rendering)
- cgltf.h
- stb_image.h
- GLEW
- GLM
