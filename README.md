Starting from August 2022, after obtaining my bachelor in IT I decided to take a year off to implement a 3D game from scratch(almost). 
The main goal is to get as much as possible hands on experience on some aspects and systems that are part of 3D game technologies.

## Current Features
- [x] Mesh Rendering
- [x] Skinned Animation
- [x] Lighting
- [x] Materials
- [ ] Font Rendering
- [ ] Immediate GUI
- [ ] Retained GUI

Currently using ~~OpenGL~~ Vulkan 1.3


## Third party libraries

- SDL2 (not used for rendering)
- cgltf.h
- stb_image.h
- GLEW
- GLM
