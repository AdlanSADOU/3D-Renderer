so I want to draw a triangle
and be able to move it

VAO
VBO
IBO
model matrix

I need a vertex array that i'm gonna transfer
into a vertex buffer

ultimately, it has to go through the pipeline,
through the vertex assembly state, vertex shader, rasterizer
then fragment shader and eventually end up in a framebuffer
that will be presented to the screen.

to do that, I have to specify to those stages what my vertex data
is going to look like;


## Maths
The dot product between two (three-component) vectors returns a
scalar (just one value) that is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors scaled by
the product of their lengths.

dot(A, B) = cos(ANGLE_BETWEEN_A_B)
ANGLE_BETWEEN_A_B = acos(DOT(A,B))
