## Thoughts

###Visual Studio rant

- F2 search and replace straight out not working
- F12 Goto definition = wrong location
- jump to header file not working on almost every file, cant find it (not an include path issue)
- shortcuts are a total mess
- hot reload often takes longer than just recompiling and executing manually...
Visual Studio 2015 worked much better in that regard

## Editor

must be launched from platform layer so that we can easily switch between game/editor
game must reflect changes made from editor as they happen
